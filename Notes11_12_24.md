# Notes: 11/12/2024 Meeting

## 1. Clone AFL++

# Useful files:

    ./custom_mutators/aflpp/aflpp.c

place hooks at line 68?
	
	./custom_mutators/custom_send_tcp/custom_send_tcp.c
useful IPC example?

## Standard AFL++ Mutator location:
	
	    ./include/afl-mutations.h
Function begins @ line 1801

Possible location for hooks?
	

## . When running Magma as per "Get Started" tutorial

```bash
cd tools/captain

# Build the docker image for AFL and a Magma target (e.g., libpng)
FUZZER=afl TARGET=libpng ./build.sh

# To start a single 24-hour fuzzing campaign, use the start.sh script

mkdir -p ./workdir
FUZZER=afl TARGET=libpng PROGRAM=libpng_read_fuzzer SHARED=./workdir POLL=5 \
  TIMEOUT=24h ./start.sh
```
	
During campaign, coverage data and other data is stored in

    magma/tools/captain/workdir/findings/plot_data

Take a look around 

    magma/tools/captain/workdir

for more possible signifiers


## 3. The collected Magma instrumentation can be found in name-timestamped files inside                     

        magma/tools/captain/workdir/afl/libpng/libpng_read_fuzzer/0/monitor 
Timestamps are recorded in seconds since
the beginning of the campaign. The contents of each monitor file are a CSV header and data row representing the global campaign bug reached and triggered counters at that timestamp. For instance, the monitor/43200 file could have the following contents:

```bash
AAH001_R, AAH001_T, AAH007_R, AAH007_T
1245, 342, 45324, 6345
```

This indicates that, up until the 12-hour mark, the AAH001 bug was reached 1245 times, and triggered 342 times, whereas the AAH007 bug was reached 45324 times, and triggered 6345 times.

These results can be summarized in a single JSON file by running:

```bash
./magma/tools/benchd/exp2json.py workdir bugs.json
```
